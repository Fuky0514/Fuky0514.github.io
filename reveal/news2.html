            <p>Previously, reports about a certain production team causing environmental damage in the Greenvale ecological reserve sparked public outrage. The production team had previously claimed unilaterally that their activities were "compliant". After an emergency investigation by the state's natural resources department, the forestry police bureau, and the procuratorial authorities, the key facts have now been ascertained.</p>
            <p>The official investigation results clearly state that the production team never submitted a formal filming application to the provincial natural resources authority and the protection zone management agency at any stage, nor did they obtain the "Administrative Permit Decision for Activities within Nature Reserves". Their unauthorized entry into the core area of the protection zone for large-scale construction, vehicle movement, and prolonged operations have directly violated multiple mandatory provisions in the "Regulations on Nature Reserves" and the "Environmental Protection Law of this State". </p>
            <p>Therefore, the so-called "filming activities of the production team" has been legally characterized as an illegal act of destruction. The investigation has discovered conclusive evidence, including unreported engineering contracts, unauthorized roads opened, and comparison evidence of the items left at the scene with those belonging to the production team. The procuratorial authorities have approved the implementation of compulsory measures against the production team's leader and the legal representatives of the related companies on the grounds of "suspected crime of illegally destroying natural resources".</p>
            <p>Regarding the "apology" and "commitment to repair" statements issued unilaterally by the production team earlier, the official notification specifically pointed out that these cannot replace or exempt them from their legal responsibilities. An ecological damage assessment is underway, and the final repair plan and compensation amount will be determined by the court's judgment.</p>
            <p>This incident, which initially was a public event that drew moral condemnation, has escalated into a criminal case that has entered the judicial process. This marks a fundamental shift in the handling approach. It sends a clear message to society: Environmental protection is a red line defined by the law. Any act of destruction under the guise of "art" or "project" will be subject to serious legal scrutiny and punishment.</p>
