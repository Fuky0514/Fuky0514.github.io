            Painter's 'AI-Blend' Scam Exposed

        <div class="news-content">
            <p>Recently, a complex scandal involving technology, integrity and popularity has emerged in the art world. Alex Lee, a young painter who has accumulated tens of thousands of followers under the tag "Pioneer of Human-Machine Collaboration" on social media, has been publicly questioned by his peers, the renowned artist Elena Chen, regarding the authenticity of his works and the legitimacy of his commercial activities. Elena Chen published a lengthy article in her personal column, using a series of detailed technical comparisons to point out that many of the high-priced works (with individual prices typically ranging from 5,000 to 30,000 RMB) sold by Alex Lee in the past two years contain significant traces of artificial intelligence generation, rather than the "fully hand-drawn masterpieces" he claimed. </p>
            <p>According to Elena Chen and some of the buyers who raised doubts, Alex Lee's operation mode is quite confusing. He usually starts by sketching some simple drafts or completing a part of the work, and then uses a large amount of AI drawing tools to generate and integrate the key details, complex textures, or overall atmosphere in the final rendering. Eventually, he produces the finished product. However, in communication with the buyers and in the sales contract, he always emphasizes the "fully handcrafted" nature of the work and the "huge amount of labor time" spent on it, and charges a fee for "artistic creation" that is much higher than the ordinary professional drawing standards in the market. When some meticulous buyers raise questions about certain overly perfect or inconsistent details in the picture, he evades the issue by citing "personal original techniques". </p>
            <p>What is more controversial is that in the past half year, Alex Lee has begun to actively participate in online debates about whether "AI can replace human art". He posted some paintings that clearly had AI characteristics and labeled as "experimental works", which triggered criticism from traditional art enthusiasts and even online violence. Later, he claimed to be "an innovator who was attacked by the conservative faction online", and responded to the controversy in a high-profile manner, thereby attracting a large amount of attention and sympathy. The number of his fans and the inquiries for his works also increased significantly. Elena Chen pointed out in her article that this "online violence incident" is very likely to be a carefully planned traffic strategy by him. The purpose is to cover up his long-term fraudulent behavior of using AI to impersonate hand-drawn works and create market topics for his high-priced works. </p>
            <p>The climax of the incident followed. Some netizens traced the digital footprints and discovered that the current account used by Alex Lee is highly associated with a network account named "Gentle Wind Gallery" that had been complained about by many people several years ago. This old account had allegedly defrauded at least a dozen art collectors by demanding a large deposit and then delaying the delivery of the artwork, resulting in the loss of contact. The case involved an amount of over 200,000 yuan and was recorded on relevant complaint platforms. This discovery directly linked his current "AI forgery" behavior to his past "collecting deposits but not delivering the artwork" misconduct, revealing that his actions were not accidental mistakes but rather a deceptive pattern. </p>
            <p>Currently, several consumers who purchased paintings from Alex Lee have begun to unite and take legal action, demanding that he explain the creation process of the works and refund the price difference. Legal experts have stated that if it is proven that the intentional concealment of the extent of AI involvement and the sale of purely handcrafted works at high prices are fraudulent, it may constitute commercial fraud. At the same time, the fraud disputes related to his old account may also be re-investigated. This incident has caused a shock in the art circle and the collecting community, prompting people to re-think what the authenticity, transparency and ethical boundaries of artistic creation are in the AI era.</p>
