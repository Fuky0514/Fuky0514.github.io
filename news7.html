            <p>艺术界近日曝出一桩涉及技术、诚信与流量的复杂丑闻。一位在社交媒体上以“人机共创先锋”为标签、积累了数万粉丝的青年画家Alex Lee，被其同行、知名艺术家Elena Chen公开质疑其作品的真实性与商业行为的正当性。Elena Chen在其个人专栏发布长文，通过一系列详细的技术比对分析指出，Alex Lee在过去两年售出的多幅高价作品（单幅标价通常在5千至3万元人民币），存在显著的人工智能生成痕迹，而非其宣称的“全手绘匠心之作”。</p>
            <p>Recently, a complex scandal involving technology, integrity and popularity has emerged in the art world. Alex Lee, a young painter who has accumulated tens of thousands of followers under the tag "Pioneer of Human-Machine Collaboration" on social media, has been publicly questioned by his peers, the renowned artist Elena Chen, regarding the authenticity of his works and the legitimacy of his commercial activities. Elena Chen published a lengthy article in her personal column, using a series of detailed technical comparisons to point out that many of the high-priced works (with individual prices typically ranging from 5,000 to 30,000 RMB) sold by Alex Lee in the past two years contain significant traces of artificial intelligence generation, rather than the "fully hand-drawn masterpieces" he claimed. </p>
            <p>据Elena Chen及部分提出质疑的购买者陈述，Alex Lee的操作模式颇具迷惑性。他通常会先手绘一些简单的草图或完成作品的一部分，然后在关键细节、复杂纹理或整体氛围渲染上，大量使用AI绘画工具进行生成与融合，最终产出成品。但在与买家的沟通和销售合同中，他始终强调作品的“全手工”属性和所耗费的“巨大工时”，并据此收取远高于市场普通行画水平的“人工创作费”。当有细心的买家对画面中某些过于完美或风格不一致的细节提出疑问时，他则以“个人独创技法”为由搪塞。</p>
            <p>According to Elena Chen and some of the buyers who raised doubts, Alex Lee's operation mode is quite confusing. He usually starts by sketching some simple drafts or completing a part of the work, and then uses a large amount of AI drawing tools to generate and integrate the key details, complex textures, or overall atmosphere in the final rendering. Eventually, he produces the finished product. However, in communication with the buyers and in the sales contract, he always emphasizes the "fully handcrafted" nature of the work and the "huge amount of labor time" spent on it, and charges a fee for "artistic creation" that is much higher than the ordinary professional drawing standards in the market. When some meticulous buyers raise questions about certain overly perfect or inconsistent details in the picture, he evades the issue by citing "personal original techniques". </p>
            <p>更具争议的是，近半年来，Alex Lee开始在网络上主动卷入关于“AI能否取代人类艺术”的论战。他发布了一些明显带有AI特征、标榜为“实验性作品”的画作，引发传统艺术爱好者的批评甚至网络暴力。他随后以“被守旧派网暴的革新者”形象自居，高调回应争议，借此吸引了大量关注和同情，粉丝数与作品询价量反而大幅上升。Elena Chen在文章中尖锐指出，这场“网暴”风波极有可能是其精心策划的流量策略，目的就是为了掩盖其长期用AI冒充手绘的欺诈行为，并为其高价作品制造市场话题。</p>
            <p>What is more controversial is that in the past half year, Alex Lee has begun to actively participate in online debates about whether "AI can replace human art". He posted some paintings that clearly had AI characteristics and labeled as "experimental works", which triggered criticism from traditional art enthusiasts and even online violence. Later, he claimed to be "an innovator who was attacked by the conservative faction online", and responded to the controversy in a high-profile manner, thereby attracting a large amount of attention and sympathy. The number of his fans and the inquiries for his works also increased significantly. Elena Chen pointed out in her article that this "online violence incident" is very likely to be a carefully planned traffic strategy by him. The purpose is to cover up his long-term fraudulent behavior of using AI to impersonate hand-drawn works and create market topics for his high-priced works. </p>
            <p>事件的高潮随之而来。有网友通过数字足迹溯源发现，Alex Lee现用账号与数年前一个已被多人投诉的、名为“Gentle Wind Gallery”的网络账号存在高度关联。该旧账号在当时便以收取高额定金后拖延交画、最终失联的方式，涉嫌诈骗了至少十余位艺术收藏爱好者，涉及金额超过二十万元，在相关投诉平台留有记录。此次发现，将其当前的“AI混真”行为与过去的“收款不交画”劣迹直接联系起来，揭示了其行为可能并非偶然失误，而是具有欺骗性的连续模式。</p>
            <p>The climax of the incident followed. Some netizens traced the digital footprints and discovered that the current account used by Alex Lee is highly associated with a network account named "Gentle Wind Gallery" that had been complained about by many people several years ago. This old account had allegedly defrauded at least a dozen art collectors by demanding a large deposit and then delaying the delivery of the artwork, resulting in the loss of contact. The case involved an amount of over 200,000 yuan and was recorded on relevant complaint platforms. This discovery directly linked his current "AI forgery" behavior to his past "collecting deposits but not delivering the artwork" misconduct, revealing that his actions were not accidental mistakes but rather a deceptive pattern. </p>
            <p>目前，多名曾向Alex Lee购画的消费者已开始联合维权，要求其说明作品创作过程并退还差价。法律界人士表示，如果故意隐瞒AI参与程度并以纯手工作品高价出售的行为被证实，可能涉嫌商业欺诈。同时，其旧账号涉及的诈骗纠纷也可能被重新调查。这起事件在艺术圈与收藏界引发地震，促使人们重新思考在AI时代，艺术创作的真实性、透明度与伦理底线究竟何在。</p>
            <p>Currently, several consumers who purchased paintings from Alex Lee have begun to unite and take legal action, demanding that he explain the creation process of the works and refund the price difference. Legal experts have stated that if it is proven that the intentional concealment of the extent of AI involvement and the sale of purely handcrafted works at high prices are fraudulent, it may constitute commercial fraud. At the same time, the fraud disputes related to his old account may also be re-investigated. This incident has caused a shock in the art circle and the collecting community, prompting people to re-think what the authenticity, transparency and ethical boundaries of artistic creation are in the AI era.</p>
