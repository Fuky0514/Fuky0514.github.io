            AI Refund Scam Reversed: Police Confirm 'Female' Customer Was Male

        <div class="news-content">
            <p>Recently, a online controversy caused by a dispute over "only refund" has undergone a reversal after the intervention of the police. A user, citing the spoilage of the food, claimed compensation from the merchant through the "only refund" function of the e-commerce platform. When asked to provide evidence, the user submitted a video showing the problem with the product. However, when the merchant reviewed the video, they discovered several unreasonable aspects - the movement trajectory of the objects in the video was stiff, and there were obvious signs of splicing in the lighting effect. Due to their vigilance against AI manipulation techniques, the merchant questioned the authenticity of the video and refused the refund request. </p>
            <p>After the refund request was rejected, the situation did not calm down. The user, identified as a woman, continued to voice her concerns on multiple social platforms, accusing the merchant of not only selling defective products but also maliciously disclosing her personal privacy information during the dispute, and attaching some screenshots of suspected harassing messages. These accusations quickly aroused the sympathy and anger of netizens, and a large number of netizens flooded the merchant's social media accounts, reporting every post they saw and abusing and threatening the merchant and its employees through private messages, causing the merchant's normal online business activities to be temporarily paralyzed. </p>
            <p>In order to clear their own names and protect their rights, the harassed merchants eventually chose to report the matter to the police. </p>
            <p>After receiving the report, the police promptly conducted a detailed investigation into the statements and evidence from both parties. After verification, the police first confirmed that during the dispute resolution process, the merchant only communicated through the built-in chat tool of the platform and did not obtain or disseminate any private information of the user. The accusation of "leaking privacy" had no factual basis.</p>
            <p>What was even more surprising was that further investigation revealed another disguise of this user. The police, by verifying the real-name information, discovered that the user who claimed to be a "lady" throughout the incident and used this identity to gain public support actually was a man. At the same time, the police entrusted the technical department to examine the controversial "spoiled food video". The report confirmed that this video was indeed fabricated using artificial intelligence technology. </p>
            <p>At this point, the truth of the incident has come to light. The actions of this male user have been suspected of using forged evidence to seek improper benefits, and later fabricating facts to mislead the public and launch cyber attacks against the business. Currently, the case is still under further investigation, and the party involved may need to bear the corresponding legal consequences for their actions. </p>
            <p>This incident has also sparked extensive discussions within the e-commerce industry. With the lowering of the threshold for AI technology, cases of using AI to forge images and videos for malicious claims occur frequently, causing losses to many merchants. Legal experts point out that such behavior has gone beyond the scope of ordinary consumer disputes. Once verified, the perpetrators may face administrative detention or even charges of fraud. Industry insiders call for platforms to establish stricter evidence review mechanisms and utilize technological means to identify AI-generated content, in order to maintain a healthy online trading environment.</p>
